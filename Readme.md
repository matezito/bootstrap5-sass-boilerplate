# How To

Clone this repo, then, into the cloned forder, run ```npm install``` and then ```npm run build``` for generate the assets folder

In the src/scss/app.scss you put files of bootsrap to use (view the file for examples), same with the src/js/app.js for bootstrap js files.

[see the docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/webpack/)

for deploys you need copy the assets folder (or css o js) into your project, the purpose of this boilerplate is modify bootstrap correctly

When you make changes, run ```npm run build``` or you can run always ```npm run watch``` for reboot the webpack server automatically
